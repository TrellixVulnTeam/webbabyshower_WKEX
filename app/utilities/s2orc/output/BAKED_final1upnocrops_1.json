Some days you may need just a dab to deal with a bit of neck strain from sitting at your computer too long. Other times you will need a big scoop of salve to help ease hamstring pain after hiking. Commercial CBD salves are not always consistent with dosage formulation. Some contain only trace amounts of CBD (around 25 mg per ounce of salve) and others an excessive amount (upward of 600 mg of CBD or more per ounce of salve). The average seems to land somewhere around 100-200 mg of CBD per ounce of salve.",

Each jar will need about one-third cup (three ounces) of simple syrup (created from sugar and water) and about two-thirds cup (six ounces) of alcohol.The following recipe creates two eight-ounce jars of cordial or one sixteenounce jar.Note: If you decide you would like to add CBD oil to your bath bomb, you will first need to decide the number of milligrams you wish to have in your bath bomb. As we're reliant on anecdotal evidence, there is not an industry standard for amounts. CBD Bath Bombs currently sold in the marketplace generally contain 50-100 mg of CBD.As with everything we've discussed pertaining to CBD dosing in this guide, start low! Try adding 50 mg of CBD per bath bomb on your initial run.If you add CBD oil to the recipe, you may still need to add hempseed oil if you're adding under 5 ml of CBD oil (one teaspoon of hemp oil is about 5 ml) The oil helps bind the ingredients in your bath bomb, so it's an essential ingredient.So, for example, assuming you wish to have 50 mg of CBD per bath bomb, you will need a total of 100 mg of CBD for the recipe, as this recipe yields two bath bombs. If your CBD oil tincture contains 25 mg of CBD per 1 ml dose, you will be adding 4 ml of CBD oil to the recipe.You need 5 ml total (one teaspoon) of oil for the recipe. Therefore, you will want to add 1 ml of hempseed oil to ensure you have the full amount needed.Once you have decided whether you wish to add CBD oil to your bath bomb and you have all your ingredients ready, to create, follow these quick and easy steps:In a large mixing bowl, combine baking soda, corn starch, citric acid, and Epsom salt. Whisk gently until evenly mixed. Be sure to remove any lumps in mixture as you whisk.In a small mixing bowl, combine essential oils, hempseed oil, and water. Whisk together until fully combined. Secure the wick so that it will stand upright while you are pouring the candle wax. A tried-and-true method is to wrap the top of the wick around a pencil and tie it. I use a wood skewer for mine. You can also buy wick sticks at your craft store for this purpose.",

Fill jar, leaving a small headspace near the rim so that wax will not spill over the jar when you first begin to burn the candle.Allow the candle to cool overnight. When cooled, trim wick to about a quarter inch. Seal the jar and let it cure for two weeks.
